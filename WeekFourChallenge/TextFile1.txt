**Create an abstract class. The theme can be of your choosing, just make sure it's something we haven't seen.
Ex: Cookie, Shape, Vehicle, etc.

**Give this class at least 3 properties and 1 virtual or abstract method.
Feel free to add more, you're not limited to just these requirements!

**Declare at least two classes that inherit from your abstract class.
Make sure you implement all required members that need to be implemented

**In your Main method, new up an instance of each class that inherits from the parent class you set up.
Make sure to set all appropriate properties.
